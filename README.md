# 03 JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

## Your Task

This week's Challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. This week's coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

The password can include special characters. If you're unfamiliar with these, see this list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP FoundationLinks

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## How to Complete the Challenge

> **Important**: Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

Clone the starter code

Modify the code to meet the Acceptance Criteria.

Ensure that your work meets the full list of grading requirements below.

Reach out to your classmates and instructional support team for help if you need it.

Follow the submission instructions.

> **Notes**: After this week, the preceding steps will not be included in Challenge instructions in order to simulate a typical work experience where the developer determines how to solve an issue on their own.

> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code
